Mission: discover tigli password to change a mark
Hack his computer and the different protection layers protecting his password

synopsis: we failed the middleware presentation with Mr.Tigli, we got a 0 and our year is doomed. This is unacceptable, we have to change this mark to validate the year. To do so, you will have to log into his account and hack the ## layers protecting it. Of course, I will provide you with guidances, don't worry. Be quick, we need to change the mark before Mr.Tigli comes back to his office.

step 1: find phone number
initial: dammit, he used the two factor authentication. very well, find his phone number
hint1: why is there a hex code ?
hint2: is the hex code related to the phone number ?
hint3: like a point to point conversion

step 2: complete Mr.Tigli's speech
initial: he used one of his own speech to protect his password ? what was it about again ?
hint1: I think it happened last year...
hint2: didn't he mention something about eating ?
hint3: with other companies like Amadeus

step #: English conditionals
initial: why is there an English exercice ? did Ms.Callaghan hack his account before us ?
hint1: it reminds me of conditional rules in english
hint2: there are three cases right ? Present -> futur
hint3: or check your previous lessons, quickly !

step last: cypher
initial: okay, we are at the last layer. We have to hack his password now and it will over
hint1: it seems to use a caesar cypher
hint2: it means the cypher has a irregular shift of letters
hint3: pay attention to the shift used for each button

success: great job ! put the new mark and log out !
unsuccess: it's too late, Mr.Tigli found you in his office, you are cooked !
